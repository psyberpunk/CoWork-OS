# Changelog

All notable changes to CoWork OS will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.60] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- npm installs could fail on macOS with `Killed: 9` during dependency lifecycle scripts due to floating dependency upgrades.
- Pinned `@whiskeysockets/baileys` to `6.7.16` and `better-sqlite3` to `12.6.2` to avoid pulling newer variants that increased install-time instability.

## [0.3.59] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- Increased default native setup outer retry attempts on macOS so `npm run setup` is more resilient to repeated transient `Killed: 9` SIGKILLs on the first run after install.

## [0.3.58] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` if the native setup retry wrapper itself was SIGKILL’d immediately after install; setup now performs outer retries (with backoff) around native setup so a transient SIGKILL doesn’t require manual re-runs.

## [0.3.57] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` if the nested `npm run setup:native` process was SIGKILL’d; setup now runs the native setup retry wrapper directly (no nested npm process) and propagates SIGKILL as exit code 137 so retries reliably trigger.

## [0.3.56] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` if macOS SIGKILL’d Node before in-process retries could run; native setup now uses a POSIX shell retry wrapper with exponential backoff so users don’t need to re-run commands manually.

## [0.3.55] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` before the retry driver could start; setup now retries native setup at the shell level (multiple attempts) so users don’t need to re-run commands manually.

## [0.3.54] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` on the first run under memory pressure; native setup now runs via a retrying driver and `setup` disables npm audit/fund to reduce peak memory usage.

## [0.3.53] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9`; native setup now prefers an Electron-targeted `better-sqlite3` rebuild via `npm rebuild` (often uses prebuilds) and only falls back to `electron-rebuild` when necessary.

## [0.3.52] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could fail with `Killed: 9` during native module rebuild; native setup now defaults to low parallelism for reliability.

## [0.3.29] - 2025-02-08
