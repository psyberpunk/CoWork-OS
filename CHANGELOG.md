# Changelog

All notable changes to CoWork OS will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.84] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Release smoke-test module resolution**: installability validation now runs Electron with `cwd` set to the installed `cowork-os` package directory so `require('better-sqlite3')` resolves correctly after setup.
- **Release continuity**: keeps the 0.3.82 npm SIGKILL regression fix while restoring end-to-end GitHub release packaging path after CI validation.

## [0.3.83] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Release workflow syntax fix**: corrected the installability smoke-test shell step so the release pipeline no longer exits with `syntax error: unexpected end of file` before desktop packaging.
- **Release continuity**: preserves the 0.3.82 npm SIGKILL fix while restoring full GitHub release asset publishing (DMG/ZIP).

## [0.3.82] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **SIGKILL regression fix for npm installs**: `setup_native` no longer uses `npm install --ignore-scripts=false` when recovering missing `better-sqlite3`, preventing `electron-winstaller` lifecycle scripts from being executed during first-time setup.
- **Recovery install hardening**: missing runtime dependency repair now uses `--omit=dev` and `--package-lock=false` to avoid reifying packaging/dev dependency trees in user runtime installs.

## [0.3.81] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **README install path hardening**: `npm run setup` now skips a full dependency reinstall when the Electron dependency is already present, so fresh `/tmp` installs avoid avoidable reinstall-driven SIGKILL pressure.
- **Native setup reliability**: restores the 0.3.71-style flow with retryable native setup and keeps `better-sqlite3` installation script-safe, then rebuilds it explicitly against Electron ABI.

## [0.3.80] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **macOS install reliability hardening**: setup now skips optional dependency reinstall during `npm run setup`, avoids propagating child SIGKILL events from native setup back to the shell, and documents a first-install flow that avoids macOS-terminating paths.
- **Release validation hardening**: CI now resolves release metadata before install validation and validates installability from either published npm tarball (if already published) or local `npm pack` fallback, preventing release regressions for first-release tags.

## [0.3.79] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **macOS install reliability carry-forward**: retained the 0.3.71 SIGKILL workaround for first-time users by documenting and reinforcing the `npm install --ignore-scripts` + `npm run --prefix node_modules/cowork-os setup` flow.
- **Release workflow hardening**: ensured the macOS release job always creates or reopens the GitHub release as a draft before packaging so `electron-builder` can attach DMG/zip assets without immutable-release failures.
- **Version alignment**: published metadata now identifies this release as `0.3.79` with the same installability and packaging reliability changes.

## [0.3.78] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Release build hardening**: restored the missing `src/electron/agent/executor-helpers.ts` source file so builds can resolve `executor.ts` imports after packaging from a fresh clone.
- **TypeScript strictness fixes**: fixed implicit `any` errors in `executor.ts` that could break release builds on CI.
- **TLS fingerprint callback typing fix**: aligned `remote-client.ts` callback signature/type usage with current `ws` client typings to satisfy strict build checks.

## [0.3.77] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Setup script safety**: `npm run setup` in a fresh install now runs dependency reinstall with `--ignore-scripts` so optional postinstall hooks like `electron-winstaller` cannot SIGKILL the process during first-run recovery on macOS.
- **Install reliability carry-forward**: this patch keeps the documented `/tmp` first-install sequence intact while ensuring setup stays stable across npm install layouts.
- **Version alignment**: published metadata is now aligned on `0.3.77` so the installability fix is included in both npm and GitHub release tracks.

## [0.3.76] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Installability restoration**: pinned `electron` to `40.2.1` so first-time installs from `npm` pull the known-good Electron patch and avoid `SIGKILL` during `node_modules/electron/install.js` on affected macOS environments.
- **README alignment**: clarified the first-time CLI install path to reflect the exact commands users should run from a fresh temporary folder.

## [0.3.75] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Installability fix from 0.3.71**: restored Electron lockfile behavior by keeping `electron` at `40.2.1` during publish-time installs, matching the working `0.3.71` state and avoiding default `SIGKILL` during `node_modules/electron/install.js` on affected installs.

## [0.3.74] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Release pipeline reliability**: updated the GitHub release publish step to find and publish the tag created by `electron-builder` instead of assuming the trigger ref matches exactly.
- **Release docs/notes alignment**: updated release notes and README "What’s new" section for `0.3.74` to reflect install and CI reliability fixes.
- **Release artifact consistency**: ensured workflow publishes desktop artifacts and release notes from the same release tag path used by electron packaging.

## [0.3.73] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Release pipeline fix**: included daemon TypeScript sources in shared ESLint targets so `npm run lint` runs instead of failing with parse errors before build/publish steps.
- **Workspace/task validation fix**: enforced `PersonalityId` validation for task agent configs to prevent runtime/inference mismatches during task creation.
- **CLI and release install tests alignment**: updated control-plane and skill validation tests to match current runtime behaviors and skill metadata output.
- **Workspace preflight reliability**: stabilized ambiguous temp-task auto-switch behavior when project-signals are present and tests now validate that behavior.

## [0.3.72] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Session workspace isolation and cleanup**: temp tasks now get session-scoped workspace IDs, dedicated temp directories, and automatic pruning by age + usage caps.
- **Autonomous task mode** in execution flow and control-plane/web-UI paths, with optional bypass of interactive approval prompts where explicitly enabled.
- **Companion-mode handling for short conversational prompts** to return concise check-in responses without running task pipeline when appropriate.
- **Search execution ordering** now prefers Brave when available and can safely fallback through configured providers automatically.
- **PDF parsing compatibility wrapper** with runtime-safe handling for both legacy and v2 parser module shapes.

### Changed
- **Task completion validation tightened** with final-response contracts (required direct answers, artifact checks, verification evidence).
- **Stricter tool failure handling** for hard/unavailable/disallowed outcomes to prevent false completion without real progress.
- **Temporary workspace handling** now uses explicit session-aware IDs and filters temp workspaces from user-visible lists consistently.
- **Search and file tools** now enforce more bounded scanning behavior and clearer fallback behavior under high-load conditions.

### Fixed
- **Watch/skip recommendation tasks** now block artifact tools and require direct recommendation output.
- **Intermittent approval/partial-task updates** reduced by normalizing auto-approved events in UI and task-stream handling.
- **Temp workspace lifecycle reliability** improved through scheduled pruning and safer restore/create paths.

## [0.3.69] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- `npm install -g cowork-os` could fail on macOS with `fsevents` (`binding.gyp not found`) due an npm 11 rebuild edge case triggered by `playwright`.
- Switched runtime browser dependency to `playwright-core` via npm alias (`playwright` package name preserved in code) to avoid the failing `fsevents` install path.
- Added launcher self-heal: on first run, `cowork-os` now verifies direct runtime dependencies and repairs missing packages with a script-free npm install pass before boot.
- Moved `@types/jszip` to `devDependencies` and excluded `@types/*` from runtime dependency checks to avoid unnecessary first-run repair installs.
- Moved `@electron/rebuild` to runtime dependencies so native fallback rebuild works in npm-installed environments.
- Fixed native setup fallback to locate `@electron/rebuild` via package exports (instead of resolving blocked subpaths), so fallback rebuild actually runs when needed.
- `cowork-os` first run now uses the shell retry wrapper for native setup, reducing one-shot startup failures when macOS kills a setup attempt under memory pressure.

## [0.3.68] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- `cowork-os` CLI startup could still fail with `better-sqlite3` ABI mismatch on first launch.
- Launcher now validates `better-sqlite3` by opening an in-memory database (not just requiring the module) and runs native setup when needed.
- Native setup script now resolves hoisted dependencies correctly (Electron and `better-sqlite3`) so it works in npm-installed layouts.

## [0.3.67] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Added npm CLI command support: `cowork-os`, `coworkctl`, `coworkd`, and `coworkd-node`.

### Fixed
- Fixed launcher script to resolve the Electron binary correctly (`require('electron')` instead of `require.resolve`).
- Included `dist/` in published npm files so the `cowork-os` command can start without requiring a local build step.
- Moved `electron` to runtime dependencies so CLI launch works after normal npm install.

## [0.3.66] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- `npm ci` could hang indefinitely in CI due an `overrides.undici` resolution loop on npm 11.
- Removed the `undici` override so release and publish jobs can complete.

## [0.3.65] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- npm publishing no longer waits for the macOS packaging job in `release.yml`.
- This prevents npm release delays when GitHub macOS runners are stalled while still allowing desktop packaging to run independently.

## [0.3.64] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Release workflow could stall for a long time at `Install dependencies` when git-based dependencies attempted SSH transport on GitHub runners.
- CI now forces GitHub git dependencies to HTTPS before `npm ci` in all release/publish jobs.
- Added explicit workflow timeouts and `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` to reduce long-running hangs during release.

## [0.3.63] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- npm installs could still fail with `SIGKILL` in transitive `protobufjs` postinstall hooks under macOS memory pressure.
- Bundled `@mariozechner/pi-ai` and `@whiskeysockets/baileys` in the published npm tarball so their transitive install scripts are not executed on end-user `npm install`.
- Restricted published package contents via `files` in `package.json` to remove large non-runtime artifacts and reduce install-time memory pressure.

## [0.3.62] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- npm installs could still fail when the package `postinstall` script itself was SIGKILL'd by macOS memory pressure.
- Removed `postinstall` from the published npm package so `npm install cowork-os@latest` no longer depends on any CoWork lifecycle hook.

## [0.3.61] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- npm installs could fail with `sh: electron-rebuild: command not found` because `postinstall` depended on a tool not available in all install contexts.
- `postinstall` now uses a best-effort native setup driver and never fails the overall npm install.
- `better-sqlite3` is now an optional dependency so transient native build failures no longer abort `npm install`; `npm run setup` now ensures it is installed before rebuild.

## [0.3.60] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- npm installs could fail on macOS with `Killed: 9` during dependency lifecycle scripts due to floating dependency upgrades.
- Pinned `@whiskeysockets/baileys` to `6.7.16` and `better-sqlite3` to `12.6.2` to avoid pulling newer variants that increased install-time instability.

## [0.3.59] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- Increased default native setup outer retry attempts on macOS so `npm run setup` is more resilient to repeated transient `Killed: 9` SIGKILLs on the first run after install.

## [0.3.58] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` if the native setup retry wrapper itself was SIGKILL’d immediately after install; setup now performs outer retries (with backoff) around native setup so a transient SIGKILL doesn’t require manual re-runs.

## [0.3.57] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` if the nested `npm run setup:native` process was SIGKILL’d; setup now runs the native setup retry wrapper directly (no nested npm process) and propagates SIGKILL as exit code 137 so retries reliably trigger.

## [0.3.56] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` if macOS SIGKILL’d Node before in-process retries could run; native setup now uses a POSIX shell retry wrapper with exponential backoff so users don’t need to re-run commands manually.

## [0.3.55] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` before the retry driver could start; setup now retries native setup at the shell level (multiple attempts) so users don’t need to re-run commands manually.

## [0.3.54] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` on the first run under memory pressure; native setup now runs via a retrying driver and `setup` disables npm audit/fund to reduce peak memory usage.

## [0.3.53] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9`; native setup now prefers an Electron-targeted `better-sqlite3` rebuild via `npm rebuild` (often uses prebuilds) and only falls back to `electron-rebuild` when necessary.

## [0.3.52] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could fail with `Killed: 9` during native module rebuild; native setup now defaults to low parallelism for reliability.
