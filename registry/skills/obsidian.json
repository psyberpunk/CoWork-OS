Don’t guess; read config.\n- Avoid writing hardcoded vault paths into scripts; prefer reading the config or using `print-default`.\n\n## obsidian-cli quick start\n\nPick a default vault (once):\n\n- `obsidian-cli set-default \"<vault-folder-name>\"`\n- `obsidian-cli print-default` / `obsidian-cli print-default --path-only`\n\nSearch\n\n- `obsidian-cli search \"query\"` (note names)\n- `obsidian-cli search-content \"query\"` (inside notes; shows snippets + lines)\n\nCreate\n\n- `obsidian-cli create \"Folder/New note\" --content \"...\" --open`\n- Requires Obsidian URI handler (`obsidian://…`) working (Obsidian installed).\n- Avoid creating notes under “hidden” dot-folders (e.g. `.something/...`) via URI; Obsidian may refuse.\n\nMove/rename (safe refactor)\n\n- `obsidian-cli move \"old/path/note\" \"new/path/note\"`\n- Updates `[[wikilinks]]` and common Markdown links across the vault (this is the main win vs `mv`).\n\nDelete\n\n- `obsidian-cli delete \"path/note\"`\n\nPrefer direct edits when appropriate: open the `.md` file and change it; Obsidian will pick it up.",
