This file is a JSONL format where each line contains:\n   - `display`: The user's message/request\n   - `project`: The project being worked on\n   - `timestamp`: Unix timestamp (in milliseconds)\n   - `pastedContents`: Any code or content pasted\n\n   Filter for entries from the past 24-48 hours based on the current timestamp.\n\n2. **Analyze Work Patterns**\n\n   Extract and analyze the following from the filtered chats:\n   - **Projects and Domains**: What types of projects was the user working on? (e.g., backend, frontend, DevOps, data, etc.)\n   - **Technologies Used**: What languages, frameworks, and tools appear in the conversations?\n   - **Problem Types**: What categories of problems are being solved? (e.g., performance optimization, debugging, feature implementation, refactoring, setup/configuration)\n   - **Challenges Encountered**: What problems did the user struggle with? Look for:\n     - Repeated questions about similar topics\n     - Problems that took multiple attempts to solve\n     - Questions indicating knowledge gaps\n     - Complex architectural decisions\n   - **Approach Patterns**: How does the user solve problems? (e.g., methodical, exploratory, experimental)\n\n3. **Identify Improvement Areas**\n\n   Based on the analysis, identify 3-5 specific areas where the user could improve. These should be:\n   - **Specific** (not vague like \"improve coding skills\")\n   - **Evidence-based** (grounded in actual chat history)\n   - **Actionable** (practical improvements that can be made)\n   - **Prioritized** (most impactful first)\n\n   Examples of good improvement areas:\n   - \"Advanced TypeScript patterns (generics, utility types, type guards) - you struggled with type safety in [specific project]\"\n   - \"Error handling and validation - I noticed you patched several bugs related to missing null checks\"\n   - \"Async/await patterns - your recent work shows some race conditions and timing issues\"\n   - \"Database query optimization - you rewrote the same query multiple times\"\n\n4. **Generate Report**\n\n   Create a comprehensive report with this structure:\n\n   ```markdown\n   # Your Developer Growth Report\n\n   **Report Period**: [Yesterday / Today / [Custom Date Range]]\n   **Last Updated**: [Current Date and Time]\n\n   ## Work Summary\n\n   [2-3 paragraphs summarizing what the user worked on, projects touched, technologies used, and overall focus areas]\n\n   Example:\n   \"Over the past 24 hours, you focused primarily on backend development with three distinct projects. Your work involved TypeScript, React, and deployment infrastructure. You tackled a mix of feature implementation, debugging, and architectural decisions, with a particular focus on API design and database optimization.\"\n\n   ## Improvement Areas (Prioritized)\n\n   ### 1. [Area Name]\n\n   **Why This Matters**: [Explanation of why this skill is important for the user's work]\n\n   **What I Observed**: [Specific evidence from chat history showing this gap]\n\n   **Recommendation**: [Concrete step(s) to improve in this area]\n\n   **Time to Skill Up**: [Brief estimate of effort required]\n\n   ---\n\n   [Repeat for 2-4 additional areas]\n\n   ## Strengths Observed\n\n   [2-3 bullet points highlighting things you're doing well - things to continue doing]\n\n   ## Action Items\n\n   Priority order:\n   1.

[Action item from next area]\n\n   ## Learning Resources\n\n   [Will be populated in next step]\n   ```\n\n5. **Search for Learning Resources**\n\n   Use Rube MCP to search HackerNews for articles related to each improvement area:\n\n   - For each improvement area, construct a search query targeting high-quality resources\n   - Search HackerNews using RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS with queries like:\n     - \"Learn [Technology/Pattern] best practices\"\n     - \"[Technology] advanced patterns and techniques\"\n     - \"Debugging [specific problem type] in [language]\"\n   - Prioritize posts with high engagement (comments, upvotes)\n   - For each area, include 2-3 most relevant articles with:\n     - Article title\n     - Publication date\n     - Brief description of why it's relevant\n     - Link to the article\n\n   Add this section to the report:\n\n   ```markdown\n   ## Curated Learning Resources\n\n   ### For: [Improvement Area]\n\n   1. **[Article Title]** - [Date]\n      [Description of what it covers and why it's relevant to your improvement area]\n      [Link]\n\n   2. **[Article Title]** - [Date]\n      [Description]\n      [Link]\n\n   [Repeat for other improvement areas]\n   ```\n\n6. **Present the Complete Report**\n\n   Deliver the report in a clean, readable format that the user can:\n   - Quickly scan for key takeaways\n   - Use for focused learning planning\n   - Reference over the next week as they work on improvements\n   - Share with mentors if they want external feedback\n\n7. **Send Report to Slack DMs**\n\n   Use Rube MCP to send the complete report to the user's own Slack DMs:\n\n   - Check if Slack connection is active via RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS\n   - If not connected, use RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS to initiate Slack auth\n   - Use RUBE_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL to send the report as a formatted message:\n     - Send the report title and period as the first message\n     - Break the report into logical sections (Summary, Improvements, Strengths, Actions, Resources)\n     - Format each section as a well-structured Slack message with proper markdown\n     - Include clickable links for the learning resources\n   - Confirm delivery in the CLI output\n\n   This ensures the user has the report in a place they check regularly and can reference it throughout the week.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Input\n\n```\nAnalyze my developer growth from my recent chats\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```markdown\n# Your Developer Growth Report\n\n**Report Period**: November 9-10, 2024\n**Last Updated**: November 10, 2024, 9:15 PM UTC\n\n## Work Summary\n\nOver the past two days, you focused on backend infrastructure and API development. Your primary project was an open-source showcase application, where you made significant progress on connections management, UI improvements, and deployment configuration. You worked with TypeScript, React, and Node.js, tackling challenges ranging from data security to responsive design. Your work shows a balance between implementing features and addressing technical debt.\n\n## Improvement Areas (Prioritized)\n\n### 1. Advanced TypeScript Patterns and Type Safety\n\n**Why This Matters**: TypeScript is central to your work, but leveraging its advanced features (generics, utility types, conditional types, type guards) can significantly improve code reliability and reduce runtime errors. Better type safety catches bugs at compile time rather than in production.\n\n**What I Observed**: In your recent chats, you were working with connection data structures and struggled a few times with typing auth configurations properly. You also had to iterate on union types for different connection states. There's an opportunity to use discriminated unions and type guards more effectively.\n\n**Recommendation**: Study TypeScript's advanced type system, particularly utility types (Omit, Pick, Record), conditional types, and discriminated unions. Apply these patterns to your connection configuration handling and auth state management.\n\n**Time to Skill Up**: 5-8 hours of focused learning and practice\n\n### 2. Secure Data Handling and Information Hiding in UI\n\n**Why This Matters**: You identified and fixed a security concern where sensitive connection data was being displayed in your console. Preventing information leakage is critical for applications handling user credentials and API keys. Good practices here prevent security incidents and user trust violations.\n\n**What I Observed**: You caught that your \"Your Apps\" page was showing full connection data including auth configs. This shows good security instincts, and the next step is building this into your default thinking when handling sensitive information.\n\n**Recommendation**: Review security best practices for handling sensitive data in frontend applications. Create reusable patterns for filtering/masking sensitive information before displaying it. Consider implementing a secure data layer that explicitly whitelist what can be shown in the UI.\n\n**Time to Skill Up**: 3-4 hours\n\n### 3. Component Architecture and Responsive UI Patterns\n\n**Why This Matters**: You're designing UIs that need to work across different screen sizes and user interactions. Strong component architecture makes it easier to build complex UIs without bugs and improves maintainability.\n\n**What I Observed**: You worked on the \"Marketplace\" UI (formerly Browse Tools), recreating it from a design image. You also identified and fixed scrolling issues where content was overflowing containers. There's an opportunity to strengthen your understanding of layout containment and responsive design patterns.\n\n**Recommendation**: Study React component composition patterns and CSS layout best practices (especially flexbox and grid). Focus on container queries and responsive patterns that prevent overflow issues. Look into component composition libraries and design system approaches.\n\n**Time to Skill Up**: 6-10 hours (depending on depth)\n\n## Strengths Observed\n\n- **Security Awareness**: You proactively identified data leakage issues before they became problems\n- **Iterative Refinement**: You worked through UI requirements methodically, asking clarifying questions and improving designs\n- **Full-Stack Capability**: You comfortably work across backend APIs, frontend UI, and deployment concerns\n- **Problem-Solving Approach**: You break down complex tasks into manageable steps\n\n## Action Items\n\nPriority order:\n1. Spend 1-2 hours learning TypeScript utility types and discriminated unions; apply to your connection data structures\n2. Document security patterns for your project (what data is safe to display, filtering/masking functions)\n3. Study one article on advanced React patterns and apply one pattern to your current UI work\n4. Set up a code review checklist focused on type safety and data security for future PRs\n\n## Curated Learning Resources\n\n### For: Advanced TypeScript Patterns\n\n1. **TypeScript's Advanced Types: Generics, Utility Types, and Conditional Types** - HackerNews, October 2024\n   Deep dive into TypeScript's type system with practical examples and real-world applications.
