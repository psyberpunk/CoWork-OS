```

CoWork-OSS is an open-source, local-first agent workbench for running multi-step tasks in a folder-scoped workspace, with explicit approvals for destructive actions and built-in skills for generating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

**You bring your own model credentials (Anthropic API / AWS Bedrock) or run locally with Ollama; usage is billed by your provider (or free with Ollama).**

> **Independent project.** CoWork-OSS is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic.
> This project implements a local, folder-scoped agent workflow pattern in open source.

**Status**: macOS desktop app (cross-platform support planned).

## Why CoWork-OSS?

- **CLI-style interface**: Terminal-inspired UI with monospace fonts, status indicators `[✓]`, and keyboard-friendly navigation
- **Local-first state**: Tasks/events/artifacts are stored locally in SQLite; model requests are sent to your configured provider (Anthropic/Bedrock). No telemetry by default
- **Folder-scoped security**: File operations are constrained to your selected workspace with path traversal protection
- **Permissioned execution**: Explicit user approval required for destructive operations (delete, bulk rename)
- **Transparent runtime**: Real-time timeline showing every step, tool call, and decision
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Use your own API credentials — no proxy, no reselling

**Note**: Today CoWork-OSS enforces workspace boundaries in-app; a VM sandbox is on the roadmap.

---

## Providers & Costs (BYOK)

CoWork-OSS is **free and open source**. To run tasks, you must configure your own model credentials or use local models.

| Provider | Configuration | Billing |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Anthropic API | Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` | Pay-per-token |
| AWS Bedrock | Configure AWS credentials in Settings | Pay-per-token via AWS |
| Ollama (Local) | Install Ollama and pull models | **Free** (runs locally) |

**Your usage is billed directly by your provider.** CoWork-OSS does not proxy or resell model access. With Ollama, everything runs on your machine for free.

## Usage

### 1. Select a Workspace

On first launch, select a folder where CoWork-OSS can work. This folder will be:
- Mounted for read/write access
- Protected by permission boundaries
- Used as the working directory for all tasks

### 2. Create a Task

Click "New Task" and describe what you want to accomplish:

**Example Tasks:**
- "Organize my Downloads folder by file type"
- "Create a quarterly report spreadsheet with Q1-Q4 data"
- "Generate a presentation about our product roadmap"
- "Analyze these CSV files and create a summary document"

### 3. Monitor Execution

Watch the task timeline as the agent:
- Creates an execution plan
- Executes steps using available tools
- Requests approvals for destructive operations
- Produces artifacts (files)

<p align="center">

</p>

### 4. Approve Requests

When the agent needs to perform destructive actions, you'll see an approval dialog. Review the details and approve or deny.

---

## Security & Safety

### Important Warnings

- **Don't point this at sensitive folders** — select only folders you're comfortable giving the agent access to
- **Use version control / backups** — always have backups of important files before running tasks
- **Review approvals carefully** — read what the agent wants to do before approving
- **Treat web content as untrusted input** — be cautious with tasks involving external data

### Workspace Boundaries

All file operations are constrained to the selected workspace folder. Path traversal attempts are rejected.

### Permission Model

```typescript
interface WorkspacePermissions {
  read: boolean;      // Read files
  write: boolean;     // Create/modify files
  delete: boolean;    // Delete files (requires approval)
  network: boolean;   // Network access (future)
}
```

### Approval Requirements

The following operations always require user approval:
- File deletion
- Bulk rename (>10 files)
- Network access beyond allowlist
- External service calls

---

## Compliance

This project requires users to comply with their model provider's terms and policies:

- [Anthropic Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms)
- [Anthropic Usage Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup)
- [AWS Bedrock Third-Party Model Terms](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/bedrock/third-party-models/)

**Note:** For consumer-facing use, Anthropic’s Usage Policy requires disclosing that users are interacting with AI at the beginning of each session. CoWork-OSS shows an explicit “AI system” disclosure when starting a new task/session.

## Trademark notice
“Cowork” is an Anthropic product name. CoWork-OSS is an independent open-source project and is not affiliated with Anthropic.
If requested by the rights holder, we will update naming/branding to avoid confusion.

## Telegram Bot Integration

CoWork-OSS supports running tasks remotely via a Telegram bot. This allows you to interact with your agent from anywhere using Telegram.

### Setting Up the Telegram Bot

#### 1. Create a Bot with BotFather

1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts to create your bot
3. Copy the bot token (looks like `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`)

#### 2. Configure in CoWork-OSS

1. Open CoWork-OSS and go to **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to the **Channels** tab
3. Enter your bot token and click **Add Telegram Channel**
4. Test the connection, then enable the channel

### Security Modes

Choose the appropriate security mode for your use case:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Pairing** (default) | Users must enter a pairing code generated in the app | Personal use, shared devices |
| **Allowlist** | Only pre-approved Telegram user IDs can interact | Team use with known users |
| **Open** | Anyone can use the bot | ⚠️ Not recommended |

### Pairing Your Telegram Account

1. In CoWork-OSS Settings → Channels, click **Generate Pairing Code**
2. Open your Telegram bot and send the pairing code
3. Once paired, you can start using the bot

### Bot Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/workspaces` | List all available workspaces |
| `/workspace <number>` | Select a workspace by number |
| `/addworkspace <path>` | Add a new workspace directory |
| `/status` | Show current session status |
| `/cancel` | Cancel the running task |

### Using the Bot

1. **Select a workspace**: Send `/workspaces` to see available folders, then `/workspace 1` to select one
2. **Create a task**: Simply type your request (e.g., "organize my downloads by file type")
3. **Monitor progress**: The bot will stream updates as the task executes
4. **View results**: Final results are sent when the task completes

### Example Conversation

```
You: /workspaces
Bot: 📂 Available workspaces:
     1. ~/Documents/project-a
     2. ~/Downloads

You: /workspace 1
Bot: ✓ Workspace selected: ~/Documents/project-a

You: List all TypeScript files and count the lines of code
Bot: 🔄 Task created... [streaming updates]
Bot: ✓ Found 23 TypeScript files with 4,521 total lines of code.
```

### Markdown Support

The bot converts responses to Telegram-compatible formatting:
- Tables are displayed as code blocks for readability
- Bold text and code formatting are preserved
- If formatting fails, plain text is sent as fallback

---

## Web Search Integration

CoWork-OSS includes a multi-provider web search system that allows the agent to search the web for information during task execution. This is useful for tasks that require current information, research, or fact-checking.

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Search Types | Best For |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Tavily** | Web, News | AI-optimized search results, recommended for most use cases |
| **Brave Search** | Web, News, Images | Privacy-focused search with good coverage |
| **SerpAPI** | Web, News, Images | Google results via API, comprehensive coverage |
| **Google Custom Search** | Web, Images | Direct Google integration, requires Search Engine ID |

### Configuration

Configure at least one provider by adding API keys to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Tavily (recommended) - https://tavily.com/
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...

# Brave Search - https://brave.com/search/api/
BRAVE_API_KEY=BSA...

# SerpAPI - https://serpapi.com/
SERPAPI_KEY=...

# Google Custom Search - https://developers.google.com/custom-search/
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=...   # Required with GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

### Settings UI

Once providers are configured, you can manage them in the app:

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to the **Web Search** tab
3. Select your **Primary Provider** - used for all searches by default
4. Optionally select a **Fallback Provider** - used automatically if primary fails

The settings panel shows:
- Which providers are configured (based on environment variables)
- Test button for each provider to verify connectivity
- Provider capabilities (web, news, images support)

### How the Agent Uses Search

When the `web_search` tool is available, the agent can:
- Search the web for current information
- Look up news articles on specific topics
- Find images (with supported providers)
- Research facts to complete tasks accurately

**Example tasks that benefit from web search:**
- "Research the latest trends in renewable energy and create a summary"
- "Find the current stock price of Apple and create a report"
- "Look up recent news about AI regulation"

### Fallback Behavior

When multiple providers are configured:
1. The **Primary Provider** is tried first
2. If it fails (network error, rate limit, etc.), the **Fallback Provider** is automatically used
3. This ensures reliable search even if one provider has issues

### Provider Auto-Detection

If no provider is explicitly selected, CoWork-OSS auto-detects available providers in this priority order:
1. Tavily (if `TAVILY_API_KEY` is set)
2. Brave (if `BRAVE_API_KEY` is set)
3. SerpAPI (if `SERPAPI_KEY` is set)
4. Google (if both `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` are set)

---

## Ollama Integration (Local LLMs)

CoWork-OSS supports running local language models via Ollama, allowing you to use the agent completely offline and free of charge.

### Setting Up Ollama

#### 1. Install Ollama

Download and install from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/):

```bash
# macOS (via Homebrew)
brew install ollama

# Or download directly from https://ollama.ai/download
```

#### 2. Pull a Model

```bash
# Recommended models for agent tasks
ollama pull llama3.2        # Fast, good for most tasks
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b     # Better reasoning
ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b # Strong coding abilities
```

#### 3. Start Ollama Server

```bash
ollama serve
# Server runs at http://localhost:11434
```

### Configuring in CoWork-OSS

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Select **Ollama (Local)** as your provider
3. Click **Refresh Models** to load available models
4. Select your preferred model from the dropdown
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify
6. Save settings

### Environment Variables (Optional)

```bash
# Custom server URL (defaults to localhost:11434)
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

# API key for remote Ollama servers with authentication
OLLAMA_API_KEY=your_key_if_needed
```

### Recommended Models

| Model | Size | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| `llama3.2` | 3B | Quick tasks, low memory |
| `llama3.2:70b` | 70B | Complex reasoning (needs ~40GB RAM) |
| `qwen2.5:14b` | 14B | Balanced performance |
| `deepseek-r1:14b` | 14B | Coding and technical tasks |
| `mistral` | 7B | General purpose |

### Notes

- **Performance**: Local models are slower than cloud APIs but completely private
- **Memory**: Larger models need more RAM (e.g., 14B models need ~16GB RAM)
- **Tool Calling**: Works best with models that support function calling (llama3.2, qwen2.5)
- **Offline**: Once models are downloaded, no internet connection is required

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Electron 40 + Node.js
- **Database**: better-sqlite3 (embedded SQLite)
- **Build**: electron-builder
