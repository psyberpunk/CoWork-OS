```

CoWork-OSS is an open-source, local-first agent workbench for running multi-step tasks in a folder-scoped workspace, with explicit approvals for destructive actions and built-in skills for generating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

**You bring your own model credentials (Anthropic API / Google Gemini / OpenRouter / OpenAI / AWS Bedrock) or run locally with Ollama; usage is billed by your provider (or free with Ollama).**

> **Independent project.** CoWork-OSS is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic.
> This project implements a local, folder-scoped agent workflow pattern in open source.

**Status**: macOS desktop app (cross-platform support planned).

## ⚠️ Safety & Data Loss Warning

**CoWork-OSS can modify, move, overwrite, or delete files** as part of normal operation — or due to bugs, misuse, or unexpected AI behavior. Before using this software, please understand and follow these guidelines:

1. **Use a separate environment when possible.** Run CoWork-OSS on a dedicated Mac, a separate user account, or a virtual machine to isolate it from your primary data.

2. **Work only in non-critical folders.** If you cannot use a separate environment, select only folders you can afford to lose. **Never point CoWork-OSS at important personal files, system folders, or production data.**

3. **Enable and verify backups before use.** Ensure Time Machine or another backup solution is running and has recent, verified backups. Test that you can restore files before relying on them.

4. **Review all approval requests carefully.** The agent will ask for permission before destructive operations, but approvals are your responsibility. Read what the agent wants to do before clicking "Approve."

5. **Expect the unexpected.** AI systems can behave unpredictably. Files may be modified or deleted even when you don't expect it. Treat every workspace as potentially at risk.

> **Disclaimer:** The maintainers and contributors of CoWork-OSS are **not responsible** for any data loss, file corruption, or other damage resulting from the use of this software. You use CoWork-OSS entirely at your own risk.

  <em>Terminal-inspired UI — because GUIs shouldn't feel like GUIs</em>
</p>

---

## Why CoWork-OSS?

- **CLI-style interface**: Terminal-inspired UI with monospace fonts, status indicators `[✓]`, and keyboard-friendly navigation
- **Local-first state**: Tasks/events/artifacts are stored locally in SQLite; model requests are sent to your configured provider (Anthropic/Bedrock). No telemetry by default
- **Folder-scoped security**: File operations are constrained to your selected workspace with path traversal protection
- **Permissioned execution**: Explicit user approval required for destructive operations (delete, bulk rename)
- **Transparent runtime**: Real-time timeline showing every step, tool call, and decision
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Use your own API credentials — no proxy, no reselling

**Note**: Today CoWork-OSS enforces workspace boundaries in-app; a VM sandbox is on the roadmap.

---

## Providers & Costs (BYOK)

CoWork-OSS is **free and open source**. To run tasks, you must configure your own model credentials or use local models.

</p>

---

## Usage

### 1. Select a Workspace

On first launch, select a folder where CoWork-OSS can work. This folder will be:
- Mounted for read/write access
- Protected by permission boundaries
- Used as the working directory for all tasks

### 2. Create a Task

Click "New Task" and describe what you want to accomplish:

**Example Tasks:**
- "Organize my Downloads folder by file type"
- "Create a quarterly report spreadsheet with Q1-Q4 data"
- "Generate a presentation about our product roadmap"
- "Analyze these CSV files and create a summary document"

### 3. Monitor Execution

Watch the task timeline as the agent:
- Creates an execution plan
- Executes steps using available tools
- Requests approvals for destructive operations
- Produces artifacts (files)

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/cowork-oss1.jpeg" alt="Task Completion" width="800">
  <br>
  <em>Task completion with verification and file tracking</em>
</p>

### 4. Approve Requests

When the agent needs to perform destructive actions, you'll see an approval dialog. Review the details and approve or deny.

---

## Security & Safety

> **See also:** [⚠️ Safety & Data Loss Warning](#%EF%B8%8F-safety--data-loss-warning) at the top of this document for critical safety guidelines.
>
> **For a comprehensive security guide**, see [SECURITY_GUIDE.md](SECURITY_GUIDE.md) which covers the app's permissions model, data storage, network connections, and best practices.

### Important Warnings

- **Don't point this at sensitive folders** — select only folders you're comfortable giving the agent access to
- **Use version control / backups** — always have backups of important files before running tasks
- **Review approvals carefully** — read what the agent wants to do before approving
- **Treat web content as untrusted input** — be cautious with tasks involving external data

### Workspace Boundaries

All file operations are constrained to the selected workspace folder. Path traversal attempts are rejected.

### Permission Model

```typescript
interface WorkspacePermissions {
  read: boolean;      // Read files
  write: boolean;     // Create/modify files
  delete: boolean;    // Delete files (requires approval)
  network: boolean;   // Network access (future)
  shell: boolean;     // Execute shell commands (requires approval)
}
```

### Approval Requirements

The following operations always require user approval:
- File deletion
- Shell command execution (when enabled)
- Bulk rename (>10 files)
- Network access beyond allowlist
- External service calls

---

## Configurable Guardrails

CoWork-OSS includes configurable safety guardrails that you can customize in **Settings > Guardrails**. These provide additional protection against runaway tasks, excessive costs, and dangerous operations.

### Available Guardrails

| Guardrail | Description | Default | Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Token Budget** | Limits total tokens (input + output) per task | 100,000 | 1K - 10M |
| **Cost Budget** | Limits estimated cost (USD) per task | $1.00 (disabled) | $0.01 - $100 |
| **Iteration Limit** | Limits LLM calls per task to prevent infinite loops | 50 | 5 - 500 |
| **Dangerous Command Blocking** | Blocks shell commands matching dangerous patterns | Enabled | On/Off + custom patterns |
| **Auto-Approve Trusted Commands** | Skip approval for safe commands (npm test, git status, etc.) | Disabled | On/Off + patterns |
| **File Size Limit** | Limits the size of files the agent can write | 50 MB | 1 - 500 MB |
| **Domain Allowlist** | Restricts browser automation to approved domains | Disabled | On/Off + domain list |

### Token & Cost Budgets

Token and cost budgets help prevent runaway tasks from consuming excessive resources:

- **Token Budget**: Tracks total input + output tokens across all LLM calls in a task
- **Cost Budget**: Calculates estimated cost based on model pricing (Claude, Gemini, GPT-4, Llama, etc.)

When a budget is exceeded, the task stops with a clear error message showing usage vs. limit.

### Dangerous Command Blocking

Built-in patterns block potentially destructive shell commands **before** they reach the approval dialog:

**Default blocked patterns:**
- `sudo` - Elevated privileges
- `rm -rf /` - Recursive deletion of root
- `mkfs` - Filesystem formatting
- `dd if=` - Direct disk writes
- Fork bombs - Process exhaustion attacks
- `curl|bash` - Piped execution from internet

You can add custom patterns (regex supported) to block additional commands specific to your environment.

### Auto-Approve Trusted Commands

For productivity, you can configure patterns for commands that auto-approve without prompts:

**Default trusted patterns** (when enabled):
- `npm test*`, `npm run *`, `npm install*` - Package manager commands
- `git status*`, `git diff*`, `git log*` - Read-only git commands
- `ls`, `pwd`, `cat *`, `head *`, `tail *` - File inspection commands
- Version checks (`node --version`, `python --version`, etc.)

You can add custom patterns using glob-style syntax (e.g., `cargo build*`, `make test*`).

### Domain Allowlist

When enabled, browser automation is restricted to approved domains only:

- Specify exact domains: `github.com`
- Use wildcards: `*.google.com` (matches all subdomains)
- Block all navigation when enabled with no domains configured

This prevents the agent from navigating to unexpected websites during browser automation tasks.

### Configuration

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to the **Guardrails** tab
3. Enable/disable guardrails using toggle switches
4. Adjust values as needed
5. Add custom blocked patterns or allowed domains
6. Click **Save Settings**

Settings are stored locally and persist across app restarts.

---

## Parallel Task Queue

CoWork-OSS supports running multiple tasks in parallel with a configurable concurrency limit. This allows you to queue up several tasks and have them execute automatically without waiting for each one to complete.

### How It Works

1. **Concurrency Limit**: Set the maximum number of tasks that can run simultaneously (1-10, default: 3)
2. **FIFO Queue**: Tasks beyond the limit are queued and processed in the order they were created
3. **Auto-Start**: When a running task completes, the next queued task automatically starts
4. **Persistence**: Queued tasks survive app restarts - they'll resume when you reopen CoWork-OSS

### Queue Panel

When tasks are running or queued, a panel appears showing:
- **Running tasks** with a spinner indicator
- **Queued tasks** with their position in the queue (#1, #2, etc.)
- **View** button to see task details
- **Cancel** button to stop or remove tasks

### Quick Task FAB

A floating action button (FAB) in the bottom-right corner lets you quickly create new tasks:
1. Click the **+** button
2. Type your task prompt
3. Press Enter or click submit
4. The task is created and queued automatically

### Toast Notifications

Real-time notifications appear when:
- A task **completes successfully** (green toast)
- A task **fails** with an error (red toast)

Click a toast to jump to that task's details.

### Configuration

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to the **Task Queue** tab
3. Adjust the **Maximum concurrent tasks** slider (1-10)
4. Click **Save Settings**

### Use Cases

- **Batch Processing**: Queue multiple file organization or document generation tasks
- **Research Tasks**: Run several web search or analysis tasks in parallel
- **Multi-Project Work**: Work on tasks across different parts of your workspace simultaneously

---

## Scheduled Tasks (Cron Jobs)

CoWork-OSS supports scheduling recurring tasks using cron expressions. This allows you to automate repetitive tasks to run at specific times or intervals, with optional delivery of results to messaging channels.

### Features

- **Cron Expressions**: Schedule tasks using standard cron syntax (minute, hour, day, month, weekday)
- **Workspace Binding**: Each scheduled task runs in a specific workspace
- **Channel Delivery**: Optionally send task results to Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, or iMessage
- **Run History**: View execution history with status, duration, and error details
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle jobs on or off without deleting them
- **Manual Trigger**: Run any scheduled task on-demand

### Setting Up Scheduled Tasks

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to the **Schedule** tab
3. Click **Add Scheduled Task**
4. Configure your task:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name for the job
   - **Schedule**: Cron expression or use the visual schedule builder
   - **Workspace**: Select the workspace where the task will run
   - **Task Prompt**: What the agent should do when triggered
   - **Channel Delivery** (optional): Select a connected channel to receive results

### Cron Expression Examples

| Schedule | Cron Expression | Description |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Every hour | `0 * * * *` | Runs at the start of every hour |
| Daily at 9am | `0 9 * * *` | Runs every day at 9:00 AM |
| Every weekday at 6pm | `0 18 * * 1-5` | Runs Monday-Friday at 6:00 PM |
| Weekly on Sunday | `0 0 * * 0` | Runs every Sunday at midnight |
| Every 30 minutes | `*/30 * * * *` | Runs every 30 minutes |
| First of month | `0 0 1 * *` | Runs on the 1st of every month at midnight |

### Visual Schedule Builder

If you're not familiar with cron syntax, use the visual schedule builder:
- Select frequency: **Hourly**, **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**
- Choose specific times and days
- The cron expression is generated automatically

### Channel Delivery

When channel delivery is enabled, task results are sent to your configured messaging channels:

1. **Task Completion**: Receive a summary when the task finishes successfully
2. **Task Failure**: Get notified immediately if a task fails
3. **Summary Mode**: Option to send only a brief summary vs. full results

Supported channels:
- Telegram
- Discord
- Slack
- WhatsApp
- iMessage

### Run History

View the execution history for each scheduled task:
- **Status**: Success ✅, Failed ❌, or Timed Out ⏱️
- **Duration**: How long the task took to execute
- **Started At**: When the task began
- **Error Details**: Error message if the task failed
- **Task ID**: Link to the full task details

### Example Use Cases

## In-App Views

CoWork-OSS provides embedded views for monitoring and interacting with agent activities directly within the main window.

### Live Command Output

When the agent executes shell commands, a live terminal view appears showing:
- **Real-time output**: See command stdout/stderr as it streams
- **Running indicator**: Visual feedback while commands execute
- **Exit code**: Shows success (0) or failure codes when complete
- **Dismissible**: Close the output panel when done reviewing
- **Auto-show**: Automatically appears when a new command starts

### Live Canvas Preview

When the agent creates visual content using Live Canvas, an interactive preview appears:
- **Interactive mode** (default): Full browser-like interaction directly in the preview
  - Click buttons, fill forms, scroll content
  - No need to open external windows for basic interactions
- **Snapshot mode**: Static screenshot with auto-refresh every 2 seconds
- **Toggle with I key**: Switch between interactive and snapshot modes
- **Resizable**: Drag the bottom edge to adjust preview height
- **Export options**: Download HTML, open in browser, show in Finder
- **History panel**: Browse through previous snapshots
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Quick access to all features (see [Live Canvas docs](docs/live-canvas.md))

Both views appear inline in the task timeline, allowing you to monitor agent activities without switching windows.

## iMessage Bot Integration (macOS Only)

CoWork-OSS supports running tasks via iMessage on macOS using the `imsg` CLI tool. This allows you to interact with your agent through Apple's native messaging platform.

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Messages app signed in
- `imsg` CLI tool installed
- Full Disk Access permission granted

### Setting Up iMessage

#### 1. Install the imsg CLI

```bash
brew install steipete/tap/imsg
```

#### 2. Grant Full Disk Access

The imsg CLI needs Full Disk Access to read the Messages database:

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Full Disk Access**
2. Enable access for your **Terminal** application (or CoWork-OSS if running as a packaged app)

#### 3. Configure in CoWork-OSS

1. Open CoWork-OSS and go to **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to the **iMessage** tab
3. Configure settings:
   - **Channel Name**: Display name for the channel
   - **Security Mode**: Choose Pairing, Allowlist, or Open
   - **DM Policy**: How to handle direct messages
   - **Group Policy**: How to handle group messages
4. Click **Connect iMessage**

### How iMessage Integration Works

Unlike other messaging platforms, iMessage integration has a unique behavior:

- **Messages from the same Apple ID** (your iPhone, iPad, etc.) are filtered as "from self"
- **Messages from other Apple IDs** are processed by the bot

This means to use the bot, you need **someone else** to message your Mac's Apple ID, or use a **different Apple ID** for the bot.

### Typical Setup

The recommended setup for an iMessage bot:

1. **Bot Mac**: Sign into Messages with a dedicated Apple ID (e.g., `bot@icloud.com`)
2. **Your Phone**: Use your personal Apple ID
3. **Message the bot**: Send messages from your phone to `bot@icloud.com`
4. **Bot responds**: Responses appear in your conversation with the bot account

### Bot Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start` | Start the bot and get help |
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/workspaces` | List all available workspaces |
| `/workspace <name>` | Select a workspace |
| `/newtask` | Start a fresh task/conversation |
| `/status` | Check bot status |
| `/cancel` | Cancel the running task |
| `/pair <code>` | Pair with a pairing code |
| `/approve` | Approve a pending request |
| `/deny` | Deny a pending request |

### Security Modes

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Pairing** (default) | Users must enter a pairing code generated in the app | Personal use |
| **Allowlist** | Only pre-approved contacts can interact | Team use |
| **Open** | Anyone can message the bot | Not recommended |

### Pairing a User

1. In CoWork-OSS Settings → iMessage, click **Generate Pairing Code**
2. The user sends the 6-character code to the bot via iMessage
3. Once verified, the user is authorized to use the bot
4. Pairing codes expire after 5 minutes

### Example Conversation

```
User: /workspaces
Bot: 📁 Available Workspaces

     1. *project-a*
        `/Users/me/Documents/project-a`

     2. *Downloads*
        `/Users/me/Downloads`

     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
     Reply with the number or name to select.
     Example: `1` or `myproject`

User: 1
Bot: ✅ *project-a* selected!
     You can now send me tasks.

User: List all JavaScript files
Bot: ⏳ Working on it...
Bot: ✅ Done!
     Found 15 JavaScript files in the workspace...
```

### Troubleshooting

**"Permission denied" error:**
- Ensure Full Disk Access is granted for Terminal or CoWork-OSS
- Try running `imsg --version` in Terminal to verify the CLI works

**Messages not being received:**
- Check that the channel status shows "Connected"
- Verify the sender is using a different Apple ID than your Mac
- Messages from your own devices (same Apple ID) are filtered out

**Bot not responding:**
- Check the CoWork-OSS logs for errors
- Ensure a workspace is selected
- Verify the user is paired/authorized

   - **Google Custom Search** - Get key and Search Engine ID from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
4. Select your **Primary Provider** - used for all searches by default
5. Optionally select a **Fallback Provider** - used automatically if primary fails
6. Click **Test** to verify connectivity
7. Save settings

The settings panel shows provider capabilities (web, news, images support) and configuration status.

### How the Agent Uses Search

When the `web_search` tool is available, the agent can:
- Search the web for current information
- Look up news articles on specific topics
- Find images (with supported providers)
- Research facts to complete tasks accurately

**Example tasks that benefit from web search:**
- "Research the latest trends in renewable energy and create a summary"
- "Find the current stock price of Apple and create a report"
- "Look up recent news about AI regulation"

### Fallback Behavior

When multiple providers are configured:
1. The **Primary Provider** is tried first
2. If it fails (network error, rate limit, etc.), the **Fallback Provider** is automatically used
3. This ensures reliable search even if one provider has issues

### Provider Auto-Detection

If no provider is explicitly selected, CoWork-OSS auto-detects available providers based on which ones have API keys configured in Settings, in this priority order:
1. Tavily
2. Brave
3. SerpAPI
4. Google (requires both API key and Search Engine ID)

## Code Tools

CoWork-OSS includes Claude Code-style tools for efficient code navigation and editing. These tools are designed for developers who need fast, precise file operations within their workspace.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **glob** | Fast pattern-based file search using glob patterns |
| **grep** | Regex-powered content search across files |
| **edit_file** | Surgical file editing with find-and-replace |

### glob - Pattern-Based File Search

Find files matching glob patterns like `**/*.ts` or `src/**/*.tsx`. Results are sorted by modification time (newest first).

**Parameters:**
- `pattern` (required): Glob pattern to match (e.g., `**/*.ts`, `*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`)
- `path` (optional): Directory to search in (defaults to workspace root)
- `maxResults` (optional): Maximum number of results (default: 100)

**Example usage by the agent:**
```
"Find all TypeScript test files"
→ glob pattern="**/*.test.ts"

"List React components in src/components"
→ glob pattern="*.tsx" path="src/components"
```

### grep - Regex Content Search

Search file contents using regular expressions. Supports context lines and multiple output modes.

**Parameters:**
- `pattern` (required): Regex pattern to search for
- `path` (optional): Directory or file to search in
- `glob` (optional): File pattern filter (e.g., `*.ts`)
- `ignoreCase` (optional): Case-insensitive search
- `contextLines` (optional): Lines of context to show around matches
- `maxResults` (optional): Maximum number of results
- `outputMode` (optional): `content` (default), `files_only`, or `count`

**Example usage by the agent:**
```
"Find all TODO comments in TypeScript files"
→ grep pattern="TODO:" glob="*.ts"

"Search for function definitions"
→ grep pattern="function\s+\w+" contextLines=2
```

### edit_file - Surgical File Editing

Make precise text replacements in files. Requires an exact match of the old string.

**Parameters:**
- `file_path` (required): Path to the file to edit
- `old_string` (required): Exact text to replace
- `new_string` (required): Replacement text
- `replace_all` (optional): Replace all occurrences (default: false)

**Example usage by the agent:**
```
"Rename the function getUser to fetchUser"
→ edit_file file_path="src/api.ts" old_string="function getUser" new_string="function fetchUser"

"Update the version number"
→ edit_file file_path="package.json" old_string="\"version\": \"1.0.0\"" new_string="\"version\": \"1.1.0\""
```

### Security

All code tools respect workspace boundaries:
- Paths outside the workspace are rejected
- Path traversal attempts (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`) are blocked
- Operations are logged in the task timeline

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

CoWork-OSS includes full support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing you to extend the agent's capabilities with external tool servers and expose CoWork's tools to external clients.

### What is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources. It enables:
- **Extensibility**: Add new tools without modifying CoWork-OSS
- **Interoperability**: Use tools from any MCP-compatible server
- **Aggregation**: Combine tools from multiple sources

### MCP Client (Connect to External Servers)

Connect to external MCP servers to use their tools within CoWork-OSS.

#### Configuration

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to the **MCP Servers** tab
3. Click **Add Server** to manually configure, or browse the **Registry**

#### Manual Server Configuration

- **Name**: Display name for the server
- **Command**: The command to launch the server (e.g., `npx`)
- **Arguments**: Command arguments (e.g., `-y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path`)
- **Environment Variables**: Any required environment variables

#### Example: Filesystem Server

```
Command: npx
Arguments: -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /Users/me/Documents
```

This exposes file operations on the specified directory as MCP tools.

### MCP Registry (One-Click Installation)

Browse and install MCP servers from the built-in registry:

1. Go to **Settings > MCP Servers > Browse Registry**
2. Search or filter by category
3. Click **Install** on any server
4. The server is automatically configured and ready to use

#### Available Servers

| Server | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Filesystem** | Read/write files in specified directories |
| **GitHub** | Interact with GitHub repos, issues, PRs |
| **Brave Search** | Web search via Brave |
| **Puppeteer** | Browser automation |
| **Memory** | Persistent key-value storage |
| **SQLite** | Query SQLite databases |
| **PostgreSQL** | Query PostgreSQL databases |
| **Fetch** | HTTP requests to external APIs |

### MCP Host (Expose CoWork's Tools)

Enable MCP Host mode to expose CoWork's tools as an MCP server for external clients like Claude Code.

#### Enabling Host Mode

1. Go to **Settings > MCP Servers > Settings**
2. Enable **MCP Host Mode**
3. The server listens on stdio for incoming connections

#### Connecting from Claude Code

Add CoWork-OSS as an MCP server in your Claude Code configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cowork": {
      "command": "/Applications/CoWork-OSS.app/Contents/MacOS/CoWork-OSS",
      "args": ["--mcp-host"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Tool Namespacing

MCP tools are prefixed with `mcp_` by default to avoid conflicts with built-in tools. You can customize this prefix in Settings.

Example: If an MCP server provides a `read_file` tool, it appears as `mcp_read_file` in CoWork-OSS.

## WebSocket Control Plane

CoWork-OSS includes a WebSocket-based Control Plane API that allows external applications to programmatically control tasks, monitor progress, and receive real-time events.

### Overview

The Control Plane provides:
- **REST-style API over WebSocket** for task management
- **Token-based authentication** with challenge-response handshake
- **Real-time event streaming** for task updates
- **Rate limiting** to prevent brute-force attacks

### Enabling the Control Plane

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to the **Control Plane** tab
3. Toggle **Enable Control Plane**
4. A secure token is automatically generated (or click **Regenerate Token**)
5. Note the port (default: `18789`) and token for client connections
6. Click **Save Settings**

### Authentication Flow

1. Client connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`
2. Server sends a `connect.challenge` event with a nonce
3. Client sends a `connect` request with the token
4. Server validates token and sends `connect.success` event
5. Client can now send requests and receive events

### Protocol

The Control Plane uses a JSON-based frame protocol:

**Request Frame:**
```json
{
  "type": "req",
  "id": "unique-request-id",
  "method": "task.create",
  "params": { "prompt": "Organize my files", "workspaceId": "ws-123" }
}
```

**Response Frame:**
```json
{
  "type": "res",
  "id": "unique-request-id",
  "ok": true,
  "payload": { "taskId": "task-456" }
}
```

**Event Frame:**
```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "event": "task.updated",
  "payload": { "taskId": "task-456", "status": "running" },
  "seq": 42
}
```

### Available Methods

| Method | Description | Parameters |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `connect` | Authenticate with the server | `token`, `deviceName?`, `nonce?` |
| `ping` | Health check | - |
| `health` | Get server health status | - |
| `task.create` | Create a new task | `prompt`, `workspaceId`, `model?` |
| `task.get` | Get task details | `taskId` |
| `task.list` | List all tasks | `limit?`, `offset?`, `status?` |
| `task.cancel` | Cancel a running task | `taskId` |
| `task.sendMessage` | Send a message to a task | `taskId`, `message` |
| `status` | Get server status | - |
| `workspace.list` | List workspaces | - |
| `workspace.get` | Get workspace details | `workspaceId` |

### Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `connect.challenge` | Authentication challenge with nonce |
| `connect.success` | Authentication successful |
| `task.created` | New task created |
| `task.updated` | Task status changed |
| `task.completed` | Task finished successfully |
| `task.failed` | Task encountered an error |
| `task.event` | Task timeline event |
| `heartbeat` | Server heartbeat |

### Example Client (TypeScript)

```typescript
import WebSocket from 'ws';

const ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:18789');
const token = 'your-control-plane-token';

ws.on('message', (data) => {
  const frame = JSON.parse(data.toString());

  if (frame.type === 'event' && frame.event === 'connect.challenge') {
    // Respond to challenge with token
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
      type: 'req',
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      method: 'connect',
      params: { token, deviceName: 'My Client' }
    }));
  }

  if (frame.type === 'event' && frame.event === 'connect.success') {
    // Authenticated! Create a task
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
      type: 'req',
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      method: 'task.create',
      params: {
        prompt: 'List all files in the workspace',
        workspaceId: 'your-workspace-id'
      }
    }));
  }

  if (frame.type === 'event' && frame.event === 'task.completed') {
    console.log('Task completed:', frame.payload);
  }
});
```

### Rate Limiting

The Control Plane includes built-in protection against brute-force attacks:
- **Max attempts**: 5 failed auth attempts before ban (configurable)
- **Ban duration**: 5 minutes (configurable)
- **IP-based**: Tracks attempts by remote IP address

### Security Considerations

- The Control Plane binds to `127.0.0.1` by default (localhost only)
- Use Tailscale Serve/Funnel for secure remote access
- Regenerate the token if compromised
- Monitor the server events for unauthorized access attempts

---

## Tailscale Integration

**Use cases:**
- Webhook integrations from external services
- Mobile apps when not on tailnet
- CI/CD pipelines triggering tasks

### Checking Tailscale Status

The Settings UI shows Tailscale status:
- **Available**: Tailscale is installed and the CLI is accessible
- **Running**: Tailscale daemon is active
- **Logged In**: You're authenticated with Tailscale
- **Machine Name**: Your device's Tailscale hostname

### Troubleshooting

**"Tailscale not available"**
- Ensure Tailscale is installed: `brew install tailscale` or download from tailscale.com
- Check if the CLI exists: `ls /Applications/Tailscale.app/Contents/MacOS/Tailscale`

**"Tailscale not running"**
- Open the Tailscale app from Applications
- Or run: `sudo tailscaled`

**"Not logged in to Tailscale"**
- Run: `tailscale login`
- Or click "Log in" in the Tailscale menu bar app

**"Serve/Funnel not working"**
- Ensure Tailscale version supports serve/funnel (v1.34+)
- Check if funnel is enabled for your tailnet (admin console)
- View logs: `tailscale serve status`

### Security Notes

- **Token required**: Even with Tailscale exposure, clients must authenticate with the Control Plane token
- **Funnel risks**: Funnel exposes your Control Plane to the internet; ensure your token is strong and secret
- **Audit access**: Monitor `task.event` and server events for unauthorized attempts
- **Disable when not needed**: Set mode to "Off" when remote access isn't required

## SSH Tunnel Support

For environments where Tailscale isn't available or preferred, CoWork-OSS supports remote access via SSH port forwarding. This provides secure, encrypted access to your Control Plane through any SSH-accessible server.

### How It Works

The Control Plane server binds to localhost (`127.0.0.1:18789`) by default. SSH tunneling forwards this local port to a remote machine, allowing clients on other networks to connect securely through the encrypted SSH connection.

```
┌─────────────────┐        SSH Tunnel        ┌─────────────────┐
│  Remote Client  │ ──────────────────────── │   Your Mac      │
│                 │   Encrypted Connection   │                 │
│ ws://localhost  │◄────────────────────────►│ Control Plane   │
│    :18789       │                          │ 127.0.0.1:18789 │
└─────────────────┘                          └─────────────────┘
```

### Setting Up an SSH Tunnel

**On the client machine** (where you want to access CoWork-OSS from):

```bash
# Create SSH tunnel - forwards local port 18789 to remote CoWork machine
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@your-mac-hostname

# Options explained:
#   -N    Don't execute remote commands (tunnel only)
#   -L    Local port forwarding: local:host:remote
```

**Keep the tunnel running** in a terminal window, or run in background:

```bash
ssh -f -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@your-mac-hostname
```

### Connecting as Remote Client

Once the SSH tunnel is established, you can either:

1. **Use the Settings UI**:
   - Open **Settings** → **Control Plane** tab
   - Select **Remote** connection mode
   - Enter `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` as the gateway URL
   - Enter your Control Plane token
   - Click **Connect**

2. **Use a WebSocket client programmatically**:
   ```javascript
   const ws = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:18789');

   ws.on('open', () => {
     // Send authentication
     ws.send(JSON.stringify({
       type: 'request',
       id: '1',
       method: 'connect',
       params: { token: 'your-control-plane-token' }
     }));
   });
   ```

### Connection Modes

The Control Plane supports two connection modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Local** | Host the Control Plane server (default) |
| **Remote** | Connect to an external Control Plane as a client |

Switch modes in **Settings** → **Control Plane** → **Connection Mode**.

### Remote Gateway Configuration

When using Remote mode, configure:

- **Gateway URL**: WebSocket URL (e.g., `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` or `wss://host:port`)
- **Auth Token**: Control Plane token from the host machine
- **Device Name**: Identifier for this client connection
- **Auto Reconnect**: Automatically reconnect on disconnection

### Security Considerations

- **SSH Key Authentication**: Use SSH keys instead of passwords for tunnel setup
- **Token Protection**: Keep your Control Plane token secret; it grants full access
- **Firewall Rules**: The Control Plane only binds to localhost; no direct external exposure
- **Connection Auditing**: Monitor server events for unauthorized connection attempts

### Troubleshooting

**"Connection refused" on client**
- Verify SSH tunnel is running: `ps aux | grep ssh`
- Check local port is forwarded: `lsof -i :18789`
- Ensure Control Plane is running on the host machine

**"Authentication failed"**
- Verify the token matches the one on the host machine
- Check that the token hasn't been regenerated since you copied it

**SSH tunnel drops frequently**
- Add keepalive to SSH config:
  ```
  Host your-mac
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
  ```
- Consider using `autossh` for persistent tunnels:
  ```bash
  autossh -M 0 -f -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@your-mac
  ```

## About This Project

**This entire application was built without writing a single line of code manually.**

I "vibe-coded" CoWork-OSS from start to finish using AI coding assistants — primarily [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) and OpenAI Codex. Every feature, every component, every bug fix was generated through conversations with AI. Yes, it burned through quite a lot of USD in API costs.

I built this tool entirely for my own use — to automate repetitive tasks on my Mac with an AI agent I could trust to stay within boundaries I set. I have **no commercial expectations** from this project.

I'm releasing it as open source so that:
- **The community can benefit** from a local-first, privacy-respecting agent workbench
- **Others can find and fix bugs** that I don't have time to track down myself
- **Developers can learn** from (or be horrified by) what AI-generated code looks like at scale

If you find bugs, please [open an issue](https://github.com/CoWork-OS/cowork-oss/issues). If you fix them, even better — PRs are welcome!

## Troubleshooting

### "No LLM provider configured"

Open **Settings** (gear icon) and configure at least one LLM provider with your API credentials.

### Electron won't start

Clear cache and rebuild:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Database locked

Close all instances of the app and delete the lock file:
```bash
rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/cowork-oss/cowork-oss.db-journal
```
