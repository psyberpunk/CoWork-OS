# CoWork OS Reference (What It Is, What It Does, How It Works)

This is the **living reference** for CoWork OS.

- Audience: contributors and power users who want a single place to understand the system.
- Scope: product capabilities, architecture, major subsystems, data storage, security model, and repo map.
- Update rule: **if a change affects behavior, capabilities, defaults, or architecture, update this file in the same PR**.
- Note: this file is also used as an optional "map" for the Memory Kit context injector (`src/electron/memory/WorkspaceKitContext.ts`), so keep the top section high-signal.

If you are looking for setup and usage docs first, start with:
- `README.md`
- `GETTING_STARTED.md`

## What CoWork OS Is

CoWork OS is a **local-first, security-first desktop runtime** for running AI agents with:
- A task execution engine (plan -> execute -> observe loops)
- A tool runtime (file ops, web, browser automation, shell, integrations)
- Messaging gateways (WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord/Slack/Teams/etc.) so you can interact with your agent remotely
- Extensibility via MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and connectors

The app is built as an **Electron main process** (backend/orchestration) plus a **React renderer** (UI).

CoWork OS also supports **server/headless deployments** intended for Linux VPS installs:

- Headless Electron daemon: `bin/coworkd.js`
- Node-only daemon (no Electron/Xvfb): `bin/coworkd-node.js` (entry: `src/daemon/main.ts`)

See: `docs/vps-linux.md`.

## What CoWork OS Can Do (Capabilities)

### 1. Run Tasks (Agent Runtime)

- Create tasks in a selected **workspace folder** and watch execution via an event timeline.
- Execute steps by calling tools (file ops, browser automation, search, connectors, etc.).
- Pause for **approvals** before destructive or high-risk actions.

Key code:
- Agent orchestration: `src/electron/agent/daemon.ts`, `src/electron/agent/executor.ts`, `src/electron/agent/queue-manager.ts`
- Tool runtime: `src/electron/agent/tools/registry.ts`

### 2. Use Tools and Skills

CoWork OS exposes "tools" to the agent. Tools include:
- Filesystem: read/write/list/rename/delete, safe path handling
- Code navigation/editing: `glob`, `grep`, `edit_file`
- Web search + web fetch (multi-provider)
- Browser automation (Playwright)
- Shell execution (sandboxed + approvals)
- Vision: analyze workspace images (screenshots/photos) via `analyze_image`
- Image generation: `generate_image` with multi-provider support (Gemini, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI) and automatic provider selection
- Visual annotation: `visual_open_annotator` / `visual_update_annotator` for iterative image refinement via Live Canvas
- Integrations: Google Drive/Gmail/Calendar, Dropbox, Box, OneDrive, SharePoint, Notion
- MCP tools from external MCP servers

Key code:
- Tool registry and execution: `src/electron/agent/tools/registry.ts`
- Image generation: `src/electron/agent/skills/image-generator.ts`
- Visual annotation tools: `src/electron/agent/tools/visual-tools.ts`
- Sandbox runner: `src/electron/agent/sandbox/runner.ts`
- Built-in skill definitions (prompted workflows): `resources/skills/`
- Skill loading precedence: `src/electron/agent/custom-skill-loader.ts`

Notes on "skills":
- Skills are JSON files (`*.json`) that define reusable workflows/prompts.
- Skill sources and precedence (highest wins):
  - Workspace skills: `<workspace>/skills/`
  - Managed skills: Electron `userData/skills/` (on macOS typically `~/Library/Application Support/cowork-os/skills/`)
  - Bundled skills: `resources/skills/`

### 3. Messaging Gateway (Channels)

CoWork OS can run as a multi-channel gateway, letting users message the agent via supported platforms.

Implemented channel adapters live in: `src/electron/gateway/channels/`

Current built-in channels (see files in that folder):
- WhatsApp
- Telegram
- Discord
- Slack
- Microsoft Teams
- Google Chat
- iMessage
- Signal
- Mattermost
- Matrix
- Twitch
- LINE
- BlueBubbles
- Email

Core gateway code:
- Gateway manager: `src/electron/gateway/index.ts`
- Router: `src/electron/gateway/router.ts`
- Shared channel types: `src/electron/gateway/channels/types.ts`

Channel commands (chat):
- `/schedule ...` creates scheduled agent tasks that deliver results back to the originating chat (works in DM + group contexts).
- `/digest [lookback]` generates an on-demand digest of recent chat messages (group-safe; uses the local channel message store).
- `/followups [lookback]` extracts follow-ups/commitments from recent chat messages (group-safe; uses the local channel message store).

Attachment handling:
- If an inbound channel message includes `attachments`, the gateway persists them under `<workspace>/.cowork/inbox/attachments/...`
- The persisted workspace paths are appended into the task prompt so agents can inspect them with normal file tools (and `analyze_image` for images)

Security modes commonly used by channels:
- `pairing`: require a pairing code
- `allowlist`: require explicit allowlisting
- `open`: no pairing/allowlist gate (still subject to tool policy)

Per-context policy:
- CoWork OS supports different tool/security restrictions for DM vs group contexts.
- See: `docs/security/trust-boundaries.md` and `src/electron/security/policy-manager.ts`

### 4. LLM Providers (BYOK) + Search Providers

LLM providers are configured in Settings (encrypted at rest) and billed directly by the provider.

Provider code:
- LLM providers: `src/electron/agent/llm/`
- LLM provider types: `src/shared/types.ts` (`LLM_PROVIDER_TYPES`)
- Search providers: `src/electron/agent/search/`

### 5. MCP (Model Context Protocol)

CoWork OS supports MCP in two directions:
- **MCP client**: connect to external MCP servers and import their tools into the agent
- **MCP host**: expose CoWork OS tools as an MCP server (stdio)

Key code:
- MCP client: `src/electron/mcp/client/`
- MCP host server: `src/electron/mcp/host/MCPHostServer.ts`
- Registry/one-click installs: `src/electron/mcp/registry/MCPRegistryManager.ts`

Enterprise connectors included in this repo (as MCP servers):
- `connectors/*-mcp/` (Salesforce, Jira, HubSpot, Zendesk, ServiceNow, Linear, Asana, Okta)
- Reference doc: `docs/enterprise-connectors.md`

### 6. Memory System (Local-First)

CoWork OS can store and retrieve local memories per workspace, with:
- Auto-capture from task execution
- Privacy protection (sensitive detection, private memories)
- Search + progressive retrieval
- Optional workspace kit (`.cowork/`) initialization + indexing for durable human-edited context
- Project contexts under `.cowork/projects/<projectId>/` with per-project access rules
- ChatGPT export import (distilled via LLM, stored locally)
- Cross-workspace search for imported ChatGPT memories (`searchImportedGlobal`)
- Local vector embeddings for memory similarity (no external API required)

Key code:
- Memory service: `src/electron/memory/MemoryService.ts`
- Local embeddings: `src/electron/memory/local-embedding.ts`
- Workspace kit extraction: `src/electron/memory/WorkspaceKitContext.ts`
- Markdown indexing + redaction: `src/electron/memory/MarkdownMemoryIndexService.ts`
- ChatGPT importer: `src/electron/memory/ChatGPTImporter.ts`
- Embedding repository: `src/electron/database/repositories.ts` (`MemoryEmbeddingRepository`)
 - Project access rules: `src/electron/security/project-access.ts`

Docs:
- Security-focused memory guidance: `docs/security/best-practices.md`

### 7. Live Canvas (Agent-Driven UI)

Live Canvas lets agents render and interact with dynamic HTML/CSS/JS during a task (with in-app preview).

Docs:
- `docs/live-canvas.md`

Code:
- Canvas runtime: `src/electron/canvas/`
- IPC handlers: `src/electron/ipc/canvas-handlers.ts`

### 8. Scheduling (Cron) + Webhook Ingress (Hooks)

Scheduling:
- Cron jobs can create tasks on schedules (`at`, `every`, `cron`) and optionally deliver results to channels.
- Cron webhooks can trigger jobs externally (disabled by default).
- For noisy monitors, delivery can be configured to only post on success when a non-empty result is available (used by `/schedule ... --if-result ...`).
- Job prompts support template variables such as `{{today}}`, `{{tomorrow}}`, `{{week_end}}`, `{{now}}`.
- If a job is configured with channel delivery (for example jobs created via `/schedule`), prompts can also use:
  - `{{chat_messages}}` (recent incoming messages for that chat)
  - `{{chat_since}}`, `{{chat_until}}` (ISO timestamps for the rendered window)
  - `{{chat_message_count}}`, `{{chat_truncated}}`

Code:
- Cron service: `src/electron/cron/service.ts`
- Cron types: `src/electron/cron/types.ts`

Defaults (see `src/electron/main.ts`):
- Cron webhook port: `9876` (disabled by default)

Webhook ingress ("Hooks"):
- Hooks provide a small HTTP server for "wake" and isolated agent runs, plus Gmail watcher support.

Code:
- Hooks server: `src/electron/hooks/server.ts`
- Hooks settings: `src/electron/hooks/settings.ts`
- Hooks types/defaults: `src/electron/hooks/types.ts`

Defaults:
- Hooks port: `9877` (when enabled)
- Hooks base path: `/hooks`

### 9. Control Plane (WebSocket Remote Management)

Control Plane is a local WebSocket server for remote clients (default loopback-only for safety).
It can be exposed via SSH tunnels or Tailscale (Serve/Funnel).

Docs:
- `docs/remote-access.md`

Code:
- Control plane server: `src/electron/control-plane/server.ts`
- Control plane protocol: `src/electron/control-plane/protocol.ts`
- Tailscale integration: `src/electron/tailscale/`

Defaults:
- Bind host: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `18789`

Capabilities:
- Operators can manage workspaces and tasks remotely over WebSocket.
- Authentication yields different client roles:
  - `operator` clients get `admin` scope (full task/workspace access, can create/cancel tasks).
  - `node` clients (mobile companions) get `read` scope and receive **redacted** task/workspace views (no prompts, no local filesystem paths).

Key methods (see `src/electron/control-plane/protocol.ts`):
- Workspaces: `workspace.list`, `workspace.get`
- Workspaces (admin): `workspace.create`
- Tasks: `task.create`, `task.get`, `task.list`, `task.cancel`, `task.sendMessage`
- Tasks (admin): `task.events`
- Approvals (admin): `approval.list`, `approval.respond`
- Channels: `channel.list`, `channel.get`
- Channels (admin): `channel.create`, `channel.update`, `channel.test`, `channel.enable`, `channel.disable`, `channel.remove`
- Config/Health: `config.get` (sanitized, no secrets)

Key events:
- `task.event` is broadcast to **operators only** (payloads are sanitized and size-capped).
- Node lifecycle + capability events: `node.connected`, `node.disconnected`, `node.capabilities_changed`, `node.event`.

### 10. Voice

Voice capabilities include:
- TTS/STT in the desktop app (ElevenLabs/OpenAI/Azure depending on settings)
- Outbound phone call tooling via ElevenLabs "ConvAI" endpoints (approval gated)

Code:
- Voice service: `src/electron/voice/VoiceService.ts`
- Phone call tool: `src/electron/agent/tools/voice-call-tools.ts`

### 11. Extensions (Plugin System)

There is a plugin/extension system scaffolded to load `cowork.plugin.json` manifests.
Treat this as **experimental** until the project formally documents/commits to the plugin ABI.

Code:
- Registry/loader/types: `src/electron/extensions/`

### 12. Mission Control (Agent Roles, Heartbeats, Standups, Task Board)

Mission Control is the in-app control surface for managing multiple agent roles and operational workflows:
- Agent roles (persona/model/tool restrictions)
- Heartbeats (scheduled "check-in" runs per agent role)
- Standup reports (daily summaries generated from task state)
- Task subscriptions (agents "watching" tasks/threads)
- Task board (columns/priorities/labels)
- Agent teams (multi-agent collaboration with shared checklists and coordinated runs)
- Performance reviews (ratings + autonomy-level recommendations for agent roles)

Key code:
- IPC handlers: `src/electron/ipc/mission-control-handlers.ts`, `src/electron/ipc/handlers.ts`
- Repos/services: `src/electron/agents/`, `src/electron/reports/StandupReportService.ts`, `src/electron/activity/`
- UI: `src/renderer/components/MissionControlPanel.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/AgentRoleEditor.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/TaskBoard.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/StandupReportViewer.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/AgentTeamsPanel.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/AgentPerformanceReviewViewer.tsx`

### 13. Desktop Shell (Tray, Notifications, Updates)

CoWork OS includes standard "app shell" features:
- Menu bar tray icon + quick input window
- Local notification store + system notifications
- Auto-update checks and GitHub releases integration (electron-updater)

Key code:
- Tray: `src/electron/tray/TrayManager.ts`, `src/electron/tray/QuickInputWindow.ts`
- Notifications: `src/electron/notifications/`
- Updates: `src/electron/updater/update-manager.ts`

### 14. Reporting / Export (Local)

CoWork OS includes local task export utilities (intended for reporting/sharing without any "phone home" telemetry).

Key code:
- Task export: `src/electron/reports/task-export.ts`

### 15. Agent Teams

There is a "Team Lead + Teammates" model for multi-agent orchestration with a shared checklist and run lifecycle.
Runs spawn child tasks and synchronize terminal task outcomes back into the checklist.

Docs/code:
- Contract: `docs/agent-teams-contract.md`
- Orchestrator: `src/electron/agents/AgentTeamOrchestrator.ts`
- Repos: `src/electron/agents/AgentTeam*Repository.ts`
- UI: `src/renderer/components/AgentTeamsPanel.tsx`

## Security Model (Summary)

CoWork OS is designed with **deny-wins** security policy precedence across multiple layers:
1. Global guardrails (blocked commands/patterns, allowed domains, budgets)
2. Workspace permissions (read/write/delete/shell/network)
3. Context restrictions (DM vs group)
4. Tool-specific rules

Key code:
- Policy engine: `src/electron/security/policy-manager.ts`
- Guardrails settings: `src/electron/guardrails/guardrail-manager.ts`
- Input/output sanitization: `src/electron/agent/security/`
- Secure settings storage: `src/electron/database/SecureSettingsRepository.ts`

Security docs:
- `docs/security/README.md`
- `SECURITY_GUIDE.md`

## Data, Storage, and Persistence

### Electron `userData` directory

CoWork OS persists state under Electron's `app.getPath('userData')` directory.
On macOS this is typically under `~/Library/Application Support/` for the app.

What is stored there (see `src/electron/database/schema.ts` migration logic):
- SQLite DB: `cowork-os.db`
- Skills (managed): `userData/skills/`
- WhatsApp auth/session data: `userData/whatsapp-auth/`
- Cron store: `userData/cron/`
- Canvas session data: `userData/canvas/`
- Notifications state: `userData/notifications/`

### Database schema (high level)

Schema creation and migrations:
- `src/electron/database/schema.ts`

Major table families (non-exhaustive):
- Tasks and execution logs: `tasks`, `task_events`, `artifacts`, `approvals`
- Workspaces: `workspaces`
- Channels + gateway state: `channels`, `channel_users`, `channel_sessions`, `channel_messages`, plus queue/rate limit/audit tables
- Memory: `memories`, `memory_summaries`, `memory_settings`, `memory_embeddings`, and optional FTS tables/triggers
- Secure encrypted settings: `secure_settings`
- "Mission Control" features: `agent_roles`, `agent_mentions`, `agent_working_state`, `task_subscriptions`, `standup_reports`, etc.
