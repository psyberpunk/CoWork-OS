## Releasing (Maintainers Only)

CoWork-OSS is published to npm for easy global installation. To release a new version:

### Release Workflow

```bash
# 1. Ensure all changes are committed and tests pass
npm test
npm run type-check

# 2. Bump version (choose one)
npm version patch   # 0.3.10 → 0.3.11 (bug fixes)
npm version minor   # 0.3.10 → 0.4.0  (new features)
npm version major   # 0.3.10 → 1.0.0  (breaking changes)

# 3. Publish to npm
npm publish

# 4. Push version commit and tag to GitHub
git push && git push --tags
```

### Version Guidelines

- **Patch** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, minor improvements
- **Minor** (0.x.0): New features, non-breaking changes

- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] README.md reflects any new features
- [ ] No sensitive data in committed files

## How to Contribute

### AI-Assisted PRs Welcome!

Built with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or other AI tools? **Awesome — we embrace it!**

This entire codebase was AI-generated, so AI-assisted contributions are first-class citizens here. Just be transparent:

- [ ] Mark as AI-assisted in your PR title or description
- [ ] Note your testing level (untested / lightly tested / fully tested)
- [ ] Confirm you understand what the code does
- [ ] Include prompts or session logs if helpful for reviewers

We just want transparency so reviewers know what to look for. Don't be shy about using AI — it's how this project was built!

### Reporting Bugs

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable and function names

- Avoid `any` type when possible

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use descriptive prop names
- Handle loading and error states
